            Once a brahmin (holy man) received a goat as a gift after performing a religious ceremony. The brahmin lifted the goat on his shoulders and left for his home.<br><br>
            It so happened that three rogues happened to see the brahmin carrying the goat.<br><br>
            They were very hungry. Seeing the goat, the first rogue exclaimed, "Oh! That is a fat goat. We should get that goat".<br><br>
            "Yes, it would make for a very nice meal for all three of us", said the second one.<br><br>
            "But how can we get the goat. The brahmin is carrying the goat on his shoulders. Am sure he won't gift it to us", said the third one.<br><br>
            "I know how to get that goat. I have a plan", said the first rogue, "Listen to me".<br><br>
            He whispered the plan into the ears of the other two. They would fool the brahmin and get the goat for themselves.<br><br>
            They ducked behind the trees by the roadside and moved past the brahmin, all the while making sure the brahmin did not see them. A little later, one of the rogues approached the brahmin.<br><br>
            "Oh! holy priest," the first rogue said politely, "I see that you are carrying a dog on your shoulders. I fail to understand why a pious person like you would carry a dog on his shoulders".<br><br>
            "Have you no eyes?" snapped the brahmin, "Can't you see it's a goat and not a dog. I received it as a gift for performing a religious ceremony extraordinarily well".<br><br>
            "Pardon me Sir, but I only say what I see with my eyes. I shall say no more", said the first rogue.<br><br>
            "Clearly, being highly educated isn't everything", the rogue muttered before leaving, making sure that the brahmin heard him.<br><br>
            The brahmin continued on his path, cursing the man for his utter foolishness.<br><br>
            He had barely walked a hundred meters when the second rogue came up to him and said, "Respected Sir, where did you find a dead calf and why are you carrying it on your shoulders? Is it not disgraceful for a brahmin to carry a dead animal?"<br><br>
            The brahmin lost his temper on hearing this. He shouted furiously at the second rogue, "What is happening to everyone? Are you also as blind as the other foolish man I met a while ago? This is no dead calf I am carrying. It is a goat that I received a little while ago."<br><br>
            The rogue pretended innocence.<br><br>
            "Forgive me Sir. I just thought I should let you know what I see. It does not matter to me whether you carry a dead calf or a live goat. Do as you please". he bowed to the brahmin and walked away.<br><br>
            The brahmin was a little puzzled now. He glanced at the animal to ensure that it was indeed a goat and continued with his journey.<br><br>
            Shortly, as planned, the third rogue appeared.<br><br>
            Upon seeing the brahmin, he frowned and said, "Pardon me Sir, are you a real brahmin?"<br><br>
            "Yes, indeed I am. What sort of a question is that?" retorted the brahmin.<br><br>
            "Then, may I ask you how a holy man such as yourself, dares to carry a pig on his shoulders? Someone as holy as you should not even touch this animal, let alone carrying it on your shoulders."<br><br>
            The brahmin became anxious.<br><br>
            Every person that he had met on his way saw a different animal on his shoulders. The first person saw a dog, the second one a dead calf and now a pig.<br><br>
            "What if I am carrying a shape-shifting monster or a goblin who could change forms?", thought the brahmin.<br><br>
            The brahmin's face turned pale at the mere thought of carrying a monster on his shoulder all this while. Scared for his life, he immediately got rid of the goat and ran home as fast as he could.<br><br>
            The rogue called out to his friends. They picked up the goat and left the place, all the while talking about the brahmin whom they fooled so easily.<br><br><br>
